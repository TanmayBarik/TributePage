                           “the most significant figure in graphic arts since Leonardo.” A 
                           pioneer and innovator, and the possessor of one of the most fertile 
                           imaginations the world has ever known.</h2>

                On December21 1937, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first full-length animated
                musical feature, premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles. Produced
                at the unheard of cost of $1,499,000 during the depths of the Great Depression, the
                film is still accounted as one of the great feats and imperishable monuments of
                the motion picture industry. During the next five years, Walt completed
                such other full-length animated classics as Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo and Bambi.

                Walt’s drive to perfect the art of animation was endless.
                Disney’s 1945 feature, the musical The Three Caballeros, combined live action with 
                the cartoon medium, a process he used successfully in such other features as Song of 
                the South and the highly acclaimed Mary Poppins. In all, 81 features were released by 
                the studio during his lifetime.Walt Disney is a legend, a folk hero of the 20th century.
                His worldwide popularity was based upon the ideas which his name represents: imagination, 
                optimism and self-made success in the American tradition.
